Contributions :
Manas Chhabra        Handling errors, debugging and testing code.
Mann Nariya          Writing the functions required for the simpleShell.

Project Description :
The main function consists of a do-while loop which is responsible for taking input of the command form the user and calling the launch function. The launch function then calls seperate_user_input function returning a " " separated array of strings
terminated by NULL. This array of strings is passed to create_process_and_run function that creates a child process and executes the input command using execvp() function.
The command input is taken to be less than 100 bytes and is assumed to have a maximum of 19 arguments. The history is only able to handle upto first 1000 commands only.

How To Run :
Run the command "gcc simpleShell.c -o shell" and run "./shell" in the same directory in wsl.

Limitations :
cd command is not supported by simpleShell because the child process cannot change the working directory of the parent process.
alias command is not supported by simpleShell because exported aliases are available only in current shell environment(i.e. parent process) and are not available to the child processes.
